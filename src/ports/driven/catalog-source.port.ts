 * adapter today; tests pass their own.
 *
 * The method keeps the adapter's `getHtml` name rather than something layer-neutral like
 * `fetchDocument`. Renaming it is 11 service call sites and their tests for no change in behaviour,
 * and this repo does scrape HTML — the name is accurate, not a leak. `SourceResult` is what actually
 * keeps the boundary honest: no upstream `Response`, status code or header reaches a service.
 *
 * `requiredMarkers` are strings the document must contain to count as `success`; without them a
 * challenge or error page classifies as a good fetch and the parser fails downstream instead.
 * `budget` overrides the per-request timeout and size ceiling for the pages known to be slow or
 * large (the character tables).
