/**
 * Whether a failed write is D1 refusing the row for being too big.
 *
 * The match is deliberately just `SQLITE_TOOBIG` — the code SQLite itself raises — and not anything
 * looser like "too big" or a size check of our own. Same reasoning as `no such table` mapping to
 * DATABASE_NOT_MIGRATED and nothing else: widen this and an ordinary bug starts getting reported to
 * the caller as a capacity limit, which sends whoever debugs it in the wrong direction.
 *
 * Measured against the real remote D1 on 2026-08-27, writing bound parameters exactly the way the
 * repositories do: 4,194,256 bytes stores, 4,194,257 raises
 * `D1_ERROR: string or blob too big: SQLITE_TOOBIG`. That is 4 MiB minus the 48 bytes the row's
 * other columns occupy — the ceiling is per **row**, confirmed by padding the primary key by 1,000
 * bytes and watching the boundary drop by the same amount. Nothing truncates: every value under the
 * ceiling reads back byte-identical.
 *
 * Note this is roughly twice what Cloudflare documents (2,000,000 bytes, "maximum string, BLOB or
 * table row size"). The undocumented headroom is not something to build on — it can be aligned with
 * the documentation at any time, and the largest payload here is already 60% of the *documented*
 * ceiling — but it is the reason this is a guard rail today rather than an outage.
